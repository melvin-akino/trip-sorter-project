Simple Trip Sorter

In order to test this module, just access the index.php.

The initial construction is very simple and straightforward since it is very direct to the point.

It uses array sort functionality for php.

The class is initialized at the beginning of the file via include and then instantiated once used. 
Pass an array of ticket cards the the module sorts it for you.

The only required parameters are source and destination.
